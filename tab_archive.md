## 2023 chapter meetings

### October 17th, 2023, Mechelen (BE)
This chapter meeting will take place at the Lamot Congress Center, in Mechelen.

We are please to welcome Asuman Senol and Georges Bolssens. 
This meeting is co-located with the [CyberSecurity event "Strategic Rsearch and Industry Impact"](https://cybersecurity-bites.be/cybersecurity-strategic-research-industry-impact-2nd-edition/)

### Agenda:
* 18h15-19h00: Welcome and refreshments
* 19h00-19h10: **OWASP Update**
* 19h10-19h50: **[Leaky Forms: A Study of Email and Password Exfiltration Before Form Submission](#leaky-forms-a-study-of-email-and-password-exfiltration-before-form-submission)** by [Asuman Senol](#asuman-senol) (Privacy Researcher at COSIC, KU Leuven BE)
* 19h50-20h30: **[Cyber breaches and how to prevent them](#cyber-breaches-and-how-to-prevent-them)** by [Georges Bolssens](#georges-bolssens) (Principal Consultant at Toreon) 

### Leaky Forms: A Study of Email and Password Exfiltration Before Form Submission 
Web users enter their email addresses into online forms for a variety of reasons, including signing in or signing up for a service or subscribing to a newsletter. While enabling such functionality, email addresses typed into forms can also be collected by third-party scripts even when users change their minds and leave the site without submitting the form. Email addresses—or identifiers derived from them—are known to be used by data brokers and advertisers for cross-site, cross-platform, and persistent identification of potentially unsuspecting individuals. In order to find out whether access to online forms is misused by online trackers, we present a measurement of email and password collection that occurs before the form submission on the top 100,000 websites. We evaluate the effect of user location, browser configuration, and interaction with consent dialogs by comparing results across two vantage points (EU/US), two browser configurations (desktop/mobile), and three consent modes. Our crawler finds and fills email and password fields, monitors the network traffic for leaks, and intercepts script access to filled input fields. Our analyses show that users’ email addresses are exfiltrated to tracking, marketing and analytics domains before form submission and without giving consent on 1,844 websites in the EU crawl and 2,950 websites in the US crawl. While the majority of email addresses are sent to known tracking domains, we further identify 41 tracker domains that are not listed by any of the popular blocklists. Furthermore, we find incidental password collection on 52 websites by third-party session replay scripts. 

### Asuman Senol
Asuman Senol is a last year PhD student at COSIC under the supervision of Assistant Prof. Gunes Acar and Prof. Claudia Diaz. She works on online tracking and web privacy. Her research involves conducting large-scale web measurement studies to investigate privacy and security issues on the Web. Before starting her doctoral studies, she worked as a full-stack web developer for 5 years. She contributes to various open source software projects thanks to her background in the industry and current academic interests in privacy and security.

### Cyber breaches and how to prevent them
 This talk explains the common threats for software applications from an attacker point of view, by using real-world data breaches and what the attacked companies could have done to prevent it.

We have selected breaches of which technical details are well understood, so we can use them as case studies, which we will approach using the following questions:
* What happened?
* Why did this happen?
* What were the consequences?
* How can you prevent it?

### Georges Bolssens

### 18 March 2021: The adventurous tale of online voting in Switzerland
This virtual chapter meeting will host **Christian Folini**!
* **When?** From 17:00 until 18:00 CET.
* **Registration?** via <https://owasp-belgium-virtual-chapter-meetings-2021.eventbrite.com/> (attendence **free of charge**)
* **Where?** Online! [YouTube Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-R52Z9wL8) - Zoom session via Eventbrite

#### The adventurous tale of online voting in Switzerland
The Swiss tale with online voting serves as a typical example of the iterative development of highly critical IT systems and the growing involvement of scientists as a necessary step for a government that is willing to learn from past mistakes.

Switzerland has been experimenting with online voting for over 15 years. Several generations of electronic voting systems have been implemented and almost all of them died along the way because of their profound security problems or when the money ran out.
In 2019, Swiss Post published the source code of its online voting system, the last system that was still in the race. Several highly critical findings were discovered in a matter of weeks and the system was stopped right before the national elections.

In 2020, the government rebooted the process and invited two dozen international researchers into an intense dialogue that lasted several months. The resulting report is at the base for the renewed regulation that will pave the way forward in 2021.


#### Christian Folini
Christian Folini is a security engineer and open source enthusiast. He holds a Ph.D. in medieval history and enjoys defending castles across Europe. Unfortunately, defending medieval castles is not a big business anymore and he turned to defending web servers, which he finds equally challenging. He brings more than ten years of experience with ModSecurity configuration in high-security environments, DDoS defense, and threat modeling.

Christian Folini is the author of the second edition of the ModSecurity Handbook and the best-known teacher on the subject. He co-leads the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set project and serves as the program chair of the "Swiss Cyber Storm" conference, the prime security conference in Switzerland.

He stood in the first line of the defenders when the Swiss Post Online Voting system was put up for a public intrusion test in 2019. The following year, he moderated a dialogue between the Swiss government and a group of two dozens researchers on online voting. This dialogue resulted in a report with several hundred pages.

Christian Folini is a frequent speaker at conferences. When speaking, he tries to use his background in the humanities to explain hardcore technical topics to audiences of different backgrounds. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrFolini)

### 17 June 2021: Upcoming open-source AWS discovery tool (by Mark Curphey and Jason Nichols)
This virtual chapter meeting will host **Mark Curphey and Jason Nichols**!
* **When?** From 17:00 until 18:00 CEST.
* **Registration?** via <https://owasp-belgium-virtual-chapter-meetings-2021.eventbrite.com/> (attendence **free of charge**)
* **Where?** Online! [YouTube Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCse6RTiGd7oxJW4i_-TkZgA) - Zoom session via Eventbrite
* **Price?** Free of charge!

#### Upcoming open-source AWS discovery tool
As we have moved to the cloud and to a data economy, more and more security decisions have moved from code to cloud infrastructure and data engineering. Mark Curphey thinks we are at the same junction in time with cloud and data as we were in 2001 when he founded OWASP. This presentation is a deep dive into a free open-source Cloud Security Posture Manager (CSPM) that he and his team at Open Raven have been building. The Crow platform discovers resources in multi-cloud environments and then checks the security configurations against best practices and known exploit conditions. It's built on a modern data stack itself and designed to scale. In this talk Mark and Jason Nichols the lead engineer will cover how Crow works, core modules such as Magpie and Rook and dive deep into writing your own security rules and reports.

#### Mark Curphey (Chief Technology Officer, Open Raven)
Former cryptographer that started OWASP, SourceClear and now [OpenRaven](http://www.openraven.com). Early at Foundstone (sold to McAfee) and late to Microsoft (ran MSDN). British expat that has been living in San Francisco for 20 years. Rides bikes and builds software.

#### Jason Nichols (Senior Software Engineer, Open Raven)
A 20 year veteran of software development, Jason was co-founder of SourceClear and has written code ranging from embedded systems to large-scale cloud deployments across a variety of industries.  He spends his free time flying an ancient airplane around his home in Pennsylvania.


### 20 May 2021: Why Attack Surface Management is Hard (by Jeremiah Grossman)
This virtual chapter meeting will host **Jeremiah Grossman**!
* **When?** From 17:00 until 18:00 CEST.
* **Registration?** via <https://owasp-belgium-virtual-chapter-meetings-2021.eventbrite.com/> (attendence **free of charge**)
* **Where?** Online! [YouTube Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCse6RTiGd7oxJW4i_-TkZgA) - Zoom session via Eventbrite
* **Price?** Free of charge!

#### Why Attack Surface Management is Hard
Everyone agrees that attack surface management is critically important, as it is the very first step of any information security program. While enterprise interest and market traction for attack surface management is building, it’s curious why every organization doesn’t already have an up-to-date attack surface map. They should! It may sound strange, but I believe it’s because attack surface management is technologically a hard problem to solve – extremely hard. This is harder to solve than most any another other problem across the entire IT and IT security industry, and harder than any other problem I’ve personally worked on. Let’s dive into the technical details of the many challenges and explore statistics of attack surface maps across the industries.


#### Jeremiah Grossman
Jeremiah Grossman's career spans nearly 20 years and has lived a literal lifetime in computer security to become one of the industry's biggest names. And since Jeremiah earned a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt, the media has described him as "the embodiment of converged IT and physical security.” Preventing attacks from the scariest cyber-criminals is all in a day's work for Jeremiah, but staying a keystroke ahead of the bad guys isn't easy. In 2001, Jeremiah founded WhiteHat Security, which today has one of the largest professional hacking armies on the planet. Let it sink in. Professional. Hacker. Army.

Jeremiah has received a number of industry awards, been publicly thanked by Microsoft, Mozilla, Google, Facebook, and many others for privately informing them of weaknesses in their systems -- a polite way of saying, ‘hacking them'. His research included ways to surreptitiously turn on anyone's computer video camera and microphone from anywhere across the Internet, sidestep firewalls, abuse online advertising networks to take any website offline, hijack the email and bank accounts of millions, silently rip out saved passwords and surfing history from web browsers, and many other cyber-attack techniques – some so insidious and fundamental that many still have not been fixed to this day.

Collectively, it's no surprise Jeremiah has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, NY Times and hundreds of other media outlets around the world who rely upon his expertise. Just type “Jeremiah Grossman” into your favorite search engine, you'll see. He also serves on the advisory board of several hot start-ups including Kenna Security, BugCrowd, SentinelOn, Arkose Labs, and LifeDNA. Of course, all of this was after Mr. Grossman served as information security officer at Yahoo!

### 18 February 2021: JWT's *"sign em like it's hot"* (by Jim Manico and Philippe De Ryck)
This virtual chapter meeting will host **Jim Manico** and **Philippe De Ryck**!

* **Where?** Stay tuned for more information!

#### JWT's *"sign em like it's hot"*

When needing to overtake an existing form of government (ie: cookie based traditional session management) one must carefully plan how to raid that traditional institution and bring about a new regime (ie: JWT based session management). Often, radical shifts in governance require new leadership institutions (key management, more challenging logout functionality, managing the increase in complexity, access control considerations, etc). Ahem.
