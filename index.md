## Upcoming events

## May 17th: 
**Securing a World of Physically Capable Computers** by ***Bruce Schneier***

### Agenda:

* 17h-18h: Welcome and refreshments
* 18h-19h: Securing a World of Physically Capable Computers (by Bruce Schneier)
#### Securing a World of Physically Capable Computers:
Computer security is no longer about data; it's about life and property. This change
makes an enormous difference, and will shake up our industry in many
ways. First, data authentication and integrity will become more
important than confidentiality. And second, our largely
regulation-free Internet will become a thing of the past. Soon we
will no longer have a choice between government regulation and no
government regulation. Our choice is between smart government
regulation and stupid government regulation. Given this future, it's
vital that we look back at what we've learned from past attempts to
secure these systems, and forward at what technologies, laws,
regulations, economic incentives, and social norms we need to secure
them in the future.

#### Bruce Schneier
is an internationally renowned security technologist, called a "security guru" by the Economist. He is the New York Times
best-selling author of 14 books -- including Click Here to Kill
Everybody -- as well as hundreds of articles, essays, and academic
papers. His influential newsletter Crypto-Gram and blog Schneier on
Security are read by over 250,000 people. Schneier is a fellow at the
Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University,
a Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, a board
member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and AccessNow, and an
advisory board member of EPIC and [VerifiedVoting.org](http://verifiedvoting.org/). He is the Chief
of Security Architecture at Inrupt, Inc.
