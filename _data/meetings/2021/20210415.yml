                    Simon Bennetts is the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Project Leader and a Distinguished Engineer at StackHawk, a company that uses ZAP to help users fix application security bugs before they hit production.

                    He has talked about and demonstrated ZAP at conferences all over the world, including Blackhat, JavaOne, FOSDEM and OWASP AppSec EU, USA & AsiaPac.

                    Prior to making the move into security he was a developer for 25 years and strongly believes that you cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.

                    In this session Simon will give an introduction to OWASP ZAP before going into more details of 2 brand new features:
                    * The Automation Framework, which is expected to become the way most people will automate ZAP
                    * A new Reporting add-on which will replace the old ZAP reports and provides much more flexibility
