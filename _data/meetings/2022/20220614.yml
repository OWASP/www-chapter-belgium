    bio           : >-
                    I have been spending the last 15 years helping people integrate their applications
                    internally and externally. I introduced IBM DataPower in Europe in 2005 and worked
                    with numerous enterprises customers deploying what were the first API Gateways.
                    I have stayed in that field since then, with a stronger focus on security in the
                    past 5 years with 42Crunch.

    title         : The Call is coming from inside- Post-Exploitation Scenarios with Kubernetes Webhooks
    abstract      : >-
                    Admission Controllers are an integral part of Kubernetes Security. Specifically, Access Control. These take the form of mutating and validating web-hooks. Kubernetes clusters use these webhooks to enforce/mutate security policy checks.
                    Everything from security context to memory limits can be enforced through the use of these webhooks. However, attackers can leverage custom-built webhooks as a way of maintaining persistence in an exploited Kubernetes cluster.
                    In this talk, I will detail the admission controller implementation in Kubernetes. I will build and deploy both mutating and validating, malicious webhooks to a cluster to demonstrate a bevy of post-exploit persistence approaches that one can leverage, entirely using Kubernetes webhooks.
