                    Together with the OWASP staff and the OWASP Netherlands chapter,
                    the OWASP Belgium chapter supports and contributes to the organisation of the
                    <a href="https://ams.globalappsec.org/">Global AppSec Amsterdam 2019</a>.
                    We kindly invite all our chapter members to join us in Amsterdam in September!<br>
                    <br>
                    Due to focusing our efforts on the Global AppSec Amsterdam conference,
                    we decided to skip this year's edition of the OWASP BeNeLux Days. <br>
                    Mark your agenda for next year: 26 and 27 November 2020 in the Netherlands.
