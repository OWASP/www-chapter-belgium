### Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Cyber Security Legislation as an IoT Device Manufacturer - Joris Gorinsek (NIKO)

**Abstract**: The world of IoT security is on the cusp of significant change with the arrival of new regulations like the EU's Radio Equipment Delegated Act (RED DA), Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and NIS2 Directive. This presentation will provide a brief overview of these upcoming legislations and their impact on the way we at Niko develop and source IoT devices.

In this presentation we'll delve into the compliance requirements for manufacturers under the RED DA and share our lessons learned. We'll outline our strategy for tackling the upcoming CRA for both in-house developed products and those sourced externally. Finally, we'll share how you, as an application security advocate, can leverage these regulations to promote a more secure future for your organization.

**About Joris Gorinsek**: For over 20 years, Joris has been deeply involved in the design and development of embedded and IoT devices. His expertise extends from low level bootloaders and Linux kernel internals all the way to smartphone applications and cloud services, with a strong focus on application security for the past 6 years.

Currently, as system architect for Niko's Home Automation department, Joris champions product security, ensuring their offerings are built using robust security practices. Lately most of his time is spent on analyzing upcoming cybersecurity legislation, assessing its impact on Niko's products, their way of working and defining optimal strategy for compliance.

Joris is a member of the Agoria industry expert group on cybersecurity legislation and a DPI Certified CISO.

### OWASP Cornucopia and Scrum: A strategic approach to introduce threat modeling in an Agile development process - Ive Verstappen & Jef Meijvis (DotNET Lab)

**Abstract**: In today’s fast-paced software development environments, embedding security within agile frameworks such as Scrum is essential. This presentation introduces OWASP Cornucopia, an effective tool for identifying and integrating security requirements into agile development cycles. We'll explore how to integrate the Cornucopia game into Scrum processes, particularly during the planning phase, to enhance security without disrupting development flow.
Participants will learn practical tips for facilitating Cornucopia games within their teams, using outcomes to improve application security, and scaling the approach based on project complexity and security needs. This presentation will provide valuable insights for Scrum Masters, product owners, developers, and security professionals aiming to better integrate security practices into their agile processes, ultimately leading to safer and more robust software products.

**About Ive Verstappen**: As the founder of dotNET lab, I am blessed to be able to work with world-class people, all of whom I respect and admire.

### User Privacy in Online Location-Based Services - Victor LePochat and Karel Dhondt (Distrinet - KU Leuven)
**Abstract**: Location-based services (LBSs) have transformed social interactions and personal experiences in the digital landscape. LBSs stand among the most popular applications on major app stores, appreciated by users for their capacity to enhance social connectivity, enabling them to seamlessly connect with others, share locations, and organize meetups. In this talk, we analyze the inherent privacy and security risks associated with the sharing of personal information and geographical locations in LBSs, with a dedicated emphasis on social privacy. We explore the extent of data exposure and leaks present in two popular categories in LBSs: fitness tracking social networks (FTSNs), where we develop a novel inference attack to circumvent privacy zones, and location-based dating (LBD) apps, where we assess which personal and sensitive data is (inadvertently) shared with other users, including victims’ exact locations.

**About Victor Le Pochat**: Victor is a postdoctoral researcher in web security and privacy at the DistriNet research unit of KU Leuven. His research interests lie in exploring large web ecosystems, understanding how to detect and mitigate harmful online content, and both analyzing and improving current research methods.

**About Karel Dhondt**: Karel is a researcher whose interests lie in the security and privacy of online location-based services.

### Signaling New Frontiers: SS7 Insights - Jeremy Schmidt (Proximus ADA)

**Abstract**: SS7 is an old protocol without any built-in security controls. Threat actors across the globe regularly attempt to abuse this protocol in order to perform malicious activities on mobile networks. This presentation details how Proximus detects, blocks and shares malicious activities observed on our SS7 network.

**About Jeremy Schmidt**: Jeremy is a seasoned Cyber Security and Incident Response Specialist at Proximus, with a distinguished tenure of over seven years. He specializes in SS7 traffic analysis, threat detection, and intelligence sharing, playing a crucial role in safeguarding telecommunications networks. In the past two years, Jeremy has been at the forefront of investigating and identifying SS7 threats, actively contributing to the GSMA community by sharing his findings and enhancing collective security measures.
