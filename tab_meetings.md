### A Mobile Security Crash Course: Application Security, Resilience, and Malware
In this talk, I will take you through the key aspects of mobile security, focusing on three main areas: application security, mobile resilience, and mobile malware. I’ll begin by introducing the OWASP Mobile Application Security (MAS) framework, sharing best practices for securing mobile apps and addressing common vulnerabilities. From there, I'll dive into mobile resilience, discussing how to protect apps from reverse engineering, tampering, and cheating, with a link back to the OWASP MAS strategies. Finally, I’ll look at the increasing threat of mobile malware, using a recent case in Belgium as an example to show how malware spreads and what steps can be taken to defend against it. By the end of the session, you'll have a well-rounded understanding of mobile security and actionable insights to protect your mobile apps and users.
