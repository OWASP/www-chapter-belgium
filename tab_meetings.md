### User Privacy in Online Location-Based Services - Victor LePochat and Karel Dhondt (Distrinet - KU Leuven)
**Abstract**: Location-based services (LBSs) have transformed social interactions and personal experiences in the digital landscape. LBSs stand among the most popular applications on major app stores, appreciated by users for their capacity to enhance social connectivity, enabling them to seamlessly connect with others, share locations, and organize meetups. In this talk, we analyze the inherent privacy and security risks associated with the sharing of personal information and geographical locations in LBSs, with a dedicated emphasis on social privacy. We explore the extent of data exposure and leaks present in two popular categories in LBSs: fitness tracking social networks (FTSNs), where we develop a novel inference attack to circumvent privacy zones, and location-based dating (LBD) apps, where we assess which personal and sensitive data is (inadvertently) shared with other users, including victimsâ€™ exact locations.

**About Victor Le Pochat**: Victor is a postdoctoral researcher in web security and privacy at the DistriNet research unit of KU Leuven. His research interests lie in exploring large web ecosystems, understanding how to detect and mitigate harmful online content, and both analyzing and improving current research methods.

**About Karel Dhondt**: Karel is a researcher whose interests lie in the security and privacy of online location-based services.

### Signaling New Frontiers: SS7 Insights - Jeremy Schmidt (Proximus ADA)

**Abstract**: SS7 is an old protocol without any built-in security controls. Threat actors across the globe regularly attempt to abuse this protocol in order to perform malicious activities on mobile networks. This presentation details how Proximus detects, blocks and shares malicious activities observed on our SS7 network.

**About Jeremy Schmidt**: Jeremy is a seasoned Cyber Security and Incident Response Specialist at Proximus, with a distinguished tenure of over seven years. He specializes in SS7 traffic analysis, threat detection, and intelligence sharing, playing a crucial role in safeguarding telecommunications networks. In the past two years, Jeremy has been at the forefront of investigating and identifying SS7 threats, actively contributing to the GSMA community by sharing his findings and enhancing collective security measures.
