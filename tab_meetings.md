#### JWT's *"sign em like it's hot"*

When needing to overtake an existing form of government (ie: cookie based traditional session management) one must carefully plan how to raid that traditional institution and bring about a new regime (ie: JWT based session management). Often, radical shifts in governance require new leadership institutions (key management, more challenging logout functionality, managing the increase in complexity, access control considerations, etc). Ahem.
