#### The hitchhikers guide to secrets for cloud environments
From API Keys to encryption keys, the number of secrets an average app requires is increasing. The talk will focus on secrets management for Kubernetes, AWS and Azure environments with some gotchas and implementation nuances

_Speaker:_ Abhay Bhargav is the Founder of we45, a focused Application Security Company. He is the Chief Architect of “Orchestron", a leading Application Vulnerability Correlation and Orchestration Framework. Abhay is a speaker and trainer at major industry events including DEF CON, BlackHat, OWASP AppSecUSA, EU and AppSecCali. His trainings have been sold-out events at conferences like AppSecUSA, EU, AppSecDay Melbourne, CodeBlue (Japan), BlackHat USA 2019, SHACK and so on.

#### Blueprint for secure JavaScript development
The Web runs on JavaScript. This session introduces patterns, tools, and processes for building secure applications in this important but often misunderstood and abused programming language.

_Speaker:_ Marcin Hoppe leads the Product Security team at Auth0, an identity platform for application builders. He is passionate about building secure applications using JavaScript and promoting security best practices and responsible disclosure in this ecosystem. Marcin is also a member of the Node.js Ecosystem Security Working Group under the OpenJS Foundation where his work is focused on running the bug bounty program for third-party Node.js packages.
