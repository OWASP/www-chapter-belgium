### Understand what you hack, not how you hack it. (By Robbe Verwilghen, penetration tester and bug bounty hunter)
***Abstract:*** Many people believe that technical knowledge and programming skills are essential for being a successful hacker. While these skills can certainly be helpful, they are not the key to becoming a great hacker. Through real-world examples of bugs discovered during his work as a bug bounty hunter and penetration tester, Robbe will demonstrate why understanding what you are hacking is more important than understanding how you are doing it.

***About Robbe:*** Robbe Verwilghen is an experienced bug bounty hunter and penetration tester, who spent time at both the hunting and triaging sides. He's the winner of 2024's "Hack The Government", organized by CCB.
He's currenlty consulting as a penetration tester at Toreon with a focus on web and mobile applications.

### Real Stories from Behind the SSDLC Curtain; A Game of SSDLC Mistake Bingo (By Hendrik Noben, co-founder at Resilix and BSides Limburg)
***Abstract:*** In this talk, we peel back the curtain on the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) and explore some real war stories. Rather than focusing on idealized process models or textbook solutions, this session highlights some messy, funny, and sometimes frustrating real-world scenarios AppSec professionals face every day. Each phase of the OWASP SAMM framework becomes a round of mistake bingo, revealing lessons learned  along the way. You’ll laugh, you’ll cringe, and you’ll likely recognize more than a few of these examples from your own experience.

***About Hendrik:*** Hendrik Noben is the co-founder of Resilix, focusing on cyber incident management and practical security assessments that lead to strategic guidance. As trusted advisor, provinding a pragmatic and people-aware approach to modern security challenges. Hendrik brings a hands-on background as a penetration tester and security architect. He is also the (co-)founder of BSides Limburg, a community-driven security event in Belgium.
