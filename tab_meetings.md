## OWASP Belgium Chapter Meeting 2023

## October 17th:
We are please to welcome Asuman Senol and Georges Bolssens. 
This meeting is co-located with the [CyberSecurity event "Strategic Rsearch and Industry Impact"](https://cybersecurity-bites.be/cybersecurity-strategic-research-industry-impact-2nd-edition/)

### Agenda:
* 18h15-19h00: Welcome and refreshments
* 19h00-19h10: **OWASP Update**
* 19h10-19h50: **[Leaky Forms: A Study of Email and Password Exfiltration Before Form Submission](#leaky-forms-a-study-of-email-and-password-exfiltration-before-form-submission)** by [Asuman Senol](#asuman-senol) (Privacy Researcher at COSIC, KU Leuven BE)
* 19h50-20h30: **[Cyber breaches and how to prevent them](#cyber-breaches-and-how-to-prevent-them)** by [Georges Bolssens](#georges-bolssens) (Principal Consultant at Toreon) 

### Leaky Forms: A Study of Email and Password Exfiltration Before Form Submission 
Web users enter their email addresses into online forms for a variety of reasons, including signing in or signing up for a service or subscribing to a newsletter. While enabling such functionality, email addresses typed into forms can also be collected by third-party scripts even when users change their minds and leave the site without submitting the form. Email addresses—or identifiers derived from them—are known to be used by data brokers and advertisers for cross-site, cross-platform, and persistent identification of potentially unsuspecting individuals. In order to find out whether access to online forms is misused by online trackers, we present a measurement of email and password collection that occurs before the form submission on the top 100,000 websites. We evaluate the effect of user location, browser configuration, and interaction with consent dialogs by comparing results across two vantage points (EU/US), two browser configurations (desktop/mobile), and three consent modes. Our crawler finds and fills email and password fields, monitors the network traffic for leaks, and intercepts script access to filled input fields. Our analyses show that users’ email addresses are exfiltrated to tracking, marketing and analytics domains before form submission and without giving consent on 1,844 websites in the EU crawl and 2,950 websites in the US crawl. While the majority of email addresses are sent to known tracking domains, we further identify 41 tracker domains that are not listed by any of the popular blocklists. Furthermore, we find incidental password collection on 52 websites by third-party session replay scripts. 

### Asuman Senol
Asuman Senol is a last year PhD student at COSIC under the supervision of Assistant Prof. Gunes Acar and Prof. Claudia Diaz. She works on online tracking and web privacy. Her research involves conducting large-scale web measurement studies to investigate privacy and security issues on the Web. Before starting her doctoral studies, she worked as a full-stack web developer for 5 years. She contributes to various open source software projects thanks to her background in the industry and current academic interests in privacy and security.

### Cyber breaches and how to prevent them
 This talk explains the common threats for software applications from an attacker point of view, by using real-world data breaches and what the attacked companies could have done to prevent it.

We have selected breaches of which technical details are well understood, so we can use them as case studies, which we will approach using the following questions:
* What happened?
* Why did this happen?
* What were the consequences?
* How can you prevent it?

### Georges Bolssens
Georges Bolssens embarked on his coding journey in the early 1990s and delved into the realm of application security in 2017. With an inherent passion for teaching, Georges is not only a seasoned developer but also an adept communicator. His unique talent lies in simplifying intricate subjects through relatable analogies, making him an engaging and effective speaker.

Having undertaken numerous consulting assignments, Georges has assumed the role of a cybersecurity educator for a diverse spectrum of professionals. His guidance has illuminated the path for individuals ranging from legal experts at renowned "Big 4" consulting firms to ethical hackers and all those in between.

In his capacity as an Application Security Consultant at Toreon, Georges has been instrumental in assisting numerous clients in constructing comprehensive threat models for their digital assets. His expertise and commitment led to his appointment as a co-instructor for Toreon's distinguished "Advanced Whiteboard Hacking – a.k.a. Hands-on Threat Modeling" course. Notably, he co-taught this course at the esteemed "BlackHat USA" conference in 2023.
