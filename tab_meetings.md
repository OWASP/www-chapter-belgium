### Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Cyber Security Legislation as an IoT Device Manufacturer - Joris Gorinsek (NIKO)

**Abstract**: The world of IoT security is on the cusp of significant change with the arrival of new regulations like the EU's Radio Equipment Delegated Act (RED DA), Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and NIS2 Directive. This presentation will provide a brief overview of these upcoming legislations and their impact on the way we at Niko develop and source IoT devices.

In this presentation we'll delve into the compliance requirements for manufacturers under the RED DA and share our lessons learned. We'll outline our strategy for tackling the upcoming CRA for both in-house developed products and those sourced externally. Finally, we'll share how you, as an application security advocate, can leverage these regulations to promote a more secure future for your organization.

**About Joris Gorinsek**: For over 20 years, Joris has been deeply involved in the design and development of embedded and IoT devices. His expertise extends from low level bootloaders and Linux kernel internals all the way to smartphone applications and cloud services, with a strong focus on application security for the past 6 years.

Currently, as system architect for Niko's Home Automation department, Joris champions product security, ensuring their offerings are built using robust security practices. Lately most of his time is spent on analyzing upcoming cybersecurity legislation, assessing its impact on Niko's products, their way of working and defining optimal strategy for compliance.

### OWASP Cornucopia and Scrum: A strategic approach to introduce threat modeling in an Agile development process - Ive Verstappen & Jef Meijvis (DotNET Lab)

**Abstract**: In todayâ€™s fast-paced software development environments, embedding security within agile frameworks such as Scrum is essential. This presentation introduces OWASP Cornucopia, an effective tool for identifying and integrating security requirements into agile development cycles. We'll explore how to integrate the Cornucopia game into Scrum processes, particularly during the planning phase, to enhance security without disrupting development flow.
Participants will learn practical tips for facilitating Cornucopia games within their teams, using outcomes to improve application security, and scaling the approach based on project complexity and security needs. This presentation will provide valuable insights for Scrum Masters, product owners, developers, and security professionals aiming to better integrate security practices into their agile processes, ultimately leading to safer and more robust software products.
