## OWASP Belgium Chapter Meeting 2022

## June 14th:
For this ON-SITE chapter meeting, we have scheduled Isabelle Mauny and Abhay Bhargav.

Both speakers are faculty of the [Secure Application Development (SecAppDev 2022)](https://secappdev.org/) course held in Leuven from 2022-06-13 to 2022-06-17.

### Agenda:

* 18h15-19h00: Welcome and refreshments
* 19h00-19h10: **OWASP Update**
* 19h10-20h00: [Top 5 of recent API Breaches - What can we learn from them? by Isabelle Mauny](#top-5-of-recent-api-breaches---what-can-we-learn-from-them)  - [Check out the PDF](assets/2022/2022-06-14/OWASP-Belgium-APISecurity.pdf)
* 20h00-20h10: ***Break***
* 20h10-21h00: [The Call is coming from inside: Post-exploitation Scenarios with Kubernetes Webhooks by Abhay Bhargav](#the-call-is-coming-from-inside-post-exploitation-scenarios-with-kubernetes-webhooks)

### Top 5 of recent API Breaches - What can we learn from them?
We will outline the root causes of some recent API vulnerabilities making the news.
* A detailed look at the underlying OWASP API security Top 10 flaws.
* Explain of how the vulnerability occurred and what we could have done to prevent it.

#### Isabelle Mauny's bio (Field CTO, 42Crunch)
 I have been spending the last 15 years helping people integrate their applications internally and externally. I introduced IBM DataPower in Europe in 2005 and worked with numerous enterprises customers deploying what were the first API Gateways. I have stayed in that field since then, with a stronger focus on security in the past 5 years with 42Crunch.

### The Call is coming from inside: Post-Exploitation Scenarios with Kubernetes Webhooks
Admission Controllers are an integral part of Kubernetes Security. Specifically, Access Control. These take the form of mutating and validating web-hooks. Kubernetes clusters use these webhooks to enforce/mutate security policy checks.\
Everything from security context to memory limits can be enforced through the use of these webhooks. However, attackers can leverage custom-built webhooks as a way of maintaining persistence in an exploited Kubernetes cluster.\
 In this talk, I will detail the admission controller implementation in Kubernetes. I will build and deploy both mutating and validating, malicious webhooks to a cluster to demonstrate a bevy of post-exploit persistence approaches that one can leverage, entirely using Kubernetes webhooks.

#### Abhay Bhargav's bio (CEO, AppSecEngineer)
Abhay Bhargav is the Founder of we45 and AppSecEngineer. He has created some pioneering works in the area of DevSecOps and AppSec Automation, including the world’s first hands-on training program on DevSecOps. In addition to this, Abhay is active in his research of new technologies and their impact on Application Security.\
Abhay is a speaker and trainer at major industry events including DEF CON, BlackHat, OWASP AppSecUSA, EU and AppSecCali. His trainings have been sold-out events at conferences like AppSecUSA, AppSecDay Melbourne, CodeBlue, BlackHat and so on.

### Securing a World of Physically Capable Computers by Bruce Schneier
#### Abstract:
Computer security is no longer about data; it’s about life and property. This change makes an enormous difference, and will shake up our industry in many ways.\
First, data authentication and integrity will become more important than confidentiality. And second, our largely regulation-free Internet will become a thing of the past. Soon we will no longer have a choice between government regulation and no government regulation. Our choice is between smart government regulation and stupid government regulation.\
Given this future, it’s vital that we look back at what we’ve learned from past attempts to secure these systems, and forward at what technologies, laws, regulations, economic incentives, and social norms we need to secure them in the future.

#### Bio:
Bruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist, called a “security guru” by the Economist. He is the New York Times best-selling author of 14 books – including * Click Here to Kill Everybody* – as well as hundreds of articles, essays, and academic papers.\
His influential newsletter Crypto-Gram and blog Schneier on Security are read by over 250,000 people. Schneier is a fellow at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, a Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and AccessNow, and an advisory board member of EPIC and VerifiedVoting.org.\
He is the Chief of Security Architecture at Inrupt, Inc.
